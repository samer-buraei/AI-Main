## 🌟 What is this?

**Vibecoding** is a project management tool built specifically for AI-assisted development. It acts as a bridge between your ideas, your codebase, and your AI agents.

The core feature is the **Project Wizard**, which allows you to:
1.  **Input** a GitHub repository URL.
2.  **Analyze** the code to detect frameworks, databases, and tools.
3.  **Interview** you to clarify goals (MVP vs. Scale).
4.  **Generate** a step-by-step task plan.
5.  **Assign** tasks to specialized AI Agents (`@frontend`, `@backend`, `@drone_specialist`).

## 🪄 Features

-   **Lazy Repo Scanner**: Instantly analyzes GitHub repos without cloning them.
-   **Skill Detective**: Automatically detects tools (Docker, PostgreSQL, Python) and recommends specialized Agents/MCPs.
-   **Orchestrator API**: A dedicated backend for managing AI workflows and session state.
-   **Custom Agents**: Define your own specialists (e.g., `@hardware`) that persist in the project memory.
-   **MCP Integration**: Connect external tools (GitHub, Slack, Sentry) to your project context.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites
-   Node.js (v18+)
-   Git

### 2. Installation
Clone the repo and install dependencies for all services:

```bash
# 1. Backend
cd vibecoding-backend
npm install

# 2. Dashboard (Frontend)
cd ../vibecoding-dashboard
npm install

# 3. MCP Server
cd ../vibecoding-mcp-server
npm install
```

### 3. Running the App
We provide a handy script to start everything at once:

```bash
# Windows
.\start-vibecoding.bat
```

4.  Click **Analyze**. The system will scan the repo and detect the tech stack.
5.  **Answer the Questions** generated by the Orchestrator.
6.  (Optional) Select **Custom Agents** or **MCP Servers** recommended by the Skill Detective.

## 📚 Documentation

-   [**Developer Guide**](./DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md) - **READ THIS FIRST** if you want to contribute. Contains the "Critical File Map" and architecture overview.
-   [**Implementation Summary**](./FINAL-IMPLEMENTATION-SUMMARY.md) - Details of the latest "Wizard" update.
-   [**Cursor MCP Integration**](./CURSOR-MCP-INTEGRATION-GUIDE.md) - How to connect this to Cursor.

## 🛠️ Architecture

The system consists of three parts:

1.  **The Brain (Backend)**: Node/Express/SQLite. Handles logic, storage, and orchestration.
2.  **The Face (Frontend)**: React/Tailwind. The visual interface for managing projects.
3.  **The Eyes (MCP Server)**: A bridge that allows Cursor to "see" the project state and fetch context.
